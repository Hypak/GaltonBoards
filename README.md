# GaltonBoards
Many people find much of the fields of statistics and probability unintuitive and hard to visualise. One device that can help is the Galton Board, which gives a very neat visualisation of how the Binomial distribution works, and in general why bell curves are so common in nature.

The classic Galton Board consists simply of a triangle of pegs, which displays the binomial distribution. This project is about extending the power of Galton Boards to model more distributions, and specifically to conditional distributions to create an intuitive model of Bayesâ€™ theorem.
